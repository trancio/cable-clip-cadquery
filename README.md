# cable-clip-cadquery

Attaching cable(s) to a wall or furniture. The number and diameter of the cables can be freely changed.

*Terminology of clip types:*
- Small: The mounting bolt does not fit under cable. More precisely: 0.9 * (cable_diameter) < bolt_head_diameter
- Big: Not Small
- Big_small: One big (with mounting hole) and one small side by side.
- Custom: The diameters of the cables and the mounting holes are given in a list.

*To customize*, you need to install on your computer:
- [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [CQ-Editor](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#adding-a-nicer-gui-via-cq-editor) (optional, but recommended)
